## How can I contribute?



If you're reading this and thinking about contributing, then welcome aboard! :wave:  

Below are a few pointers on ways you can help us out...


### Open a pull request
If you already have a proposal for a new section or would like to suggest an improvement to existing documentation, then you can open a pull request:

- Create a new branch with an appropriate name and [commit your changes](https://github.com/bbc/news-apps-developer-docs/blob/master/git/commit-messages.md)
- Include a brief explanation of the reasons behind the change in the pull request description
- Aim to reach a consensus in the discussion and address any comments or suggestions
- Once your changes have been approved, they can be merged to the master branch

### Open an issue
If you think there's something missing from these docs, if you'd like to ask a question, or if there needs to be a more general discussion before moving to a proposal, then you can open an [issue](https://github.com/bbc/news-apps-developer-docs/issues):

- Make sure to include sufficient detail for a proper discussion
- Try to include enough context so that anyone can understand what the issue is about
- Consider adding labels to make it clearer what _kind_ of issue you've created

### Get involved

You don't have to create a pull request or open an issue to contribute to the project. Getting involved in the conversations around pull requests and open issues is equally important for helping us to reach consensus and offer a wide range of different perspectives on a particular topic.
