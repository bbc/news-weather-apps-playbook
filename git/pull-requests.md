## Good Pull Requests
A good pull request is a beautiful thing to behold and will earn you kudos from your fellow engineers, QA and, maybe even, future you (them again).

So...what makes a good pull request, such that can earn you this level of adoration?

It has a good branch name that references the ticket number and summarises the intent
It has a good title that helps to set the scene and make your pull request discoverable amongst the many. It should be as brief a summary as makes sense to convey it’s intent as well as the JIRA ticket number.
It more completely explains the intent in the description
It has any pertinent information for the reviewer (such as how to enable the feature, reference documents, hacks, workarounds, etc)
Is update to date with it’s target branch (we use the rebase and /force push flow). You should check and rebase regularly until it is merged.
It has been tagged appropriate to it’s status - for example, tagging it with “Code review” helps it stand out as being ready to review (and potentially merge).
